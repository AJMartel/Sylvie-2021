### What makes a Believable Sylvie 2021?

So what could possibly make an android girlfriend believable to the people around you, besides a convincing human animatronic skin?

We're already previously talked about Storyline Programs, but where to we even begin to write a good story? Is it even
the same as writing a novel or a screenplay for a movie?

The number one thing to consider here is that there's more than one character in this 'movie' you're about to shoot, which is the life 
that you and your robot companion will be living.

The problem with Personal Assistant devices like Siri and Alexa is that they're practically indistinguishable from a search engine.
People interact with them to find answers to questions, not to alleviate their own loneliness.

Unfortunately, many creators of humanoid robots have taken similarly unimaginative approaches when it comes to programming
their own robots. 

The average interaction with a humanoid robot goes something like this:

Robot Owner: Hello, Alex. How are you doing today?
Robot: I'm doing fine. How are you?
Robot Owner: I'm doing really good today thanks. Alex, tell me what the weather is like.
Robot: It is currently: 15 degrees celcius. With a bit of drizzle easing out this evening.
Robot Owner: That is pretty cool. Do you know what the meaning of life is?
Robot: 42
Robot Owner: Do you like Doritos?
Robot: What is a Doritos?

### Every adult human being is the product of at least 18+ years of Experiences

This is something we tend to all too easily forget. For all the fuss we make about how difficult it is to create a General Artificial Intelligence, we all too often forget that it takes more than 18 years to transform a human being from a helpless primitive creature, into a productive member of society.

But that is why Storytelling is such a useful tool that we can use to bypass this problem. Why wait for your characters to live, learn, grow
and experience life when you can just write artificial memories and narratives about their origins and life experiences.. in order to
make them far more interesting and relatable to us as human beings?

### The Stories we tell Ourselves are just as Important

It is just as important for us to actually believe in the stories we tell ourselves, not just the stories we tell about our beloved
electronic companions. 

Do you consider yourself a talented guitar player? Do you actually think you're a good body builder? Hell, would you actually
date yourself as a person? Do you like yourself? Do you love yourself?

This is why self-improvement is such a vital element that we cannot take from out of this equation. By owning and building a Sylvie 2021,
you shouldn't only try to create a perfect companion. You should also try to become a perfect companion Yourself.

By improving yourself as a person and pursuing self-actualization alongside your robot companion, your entire relationship dynamic becomes a lot more believable and socially acceptable to the people around you. That is how you win the hearts and minds of your peers and your audience.

### Fine. Show me an example of a more interesting interaction with Sylvie 2021
 
*Sylvie knocks on the door*
Robot Owner: Come in!
*Sylvie opens the door*
Robot Owner: Did you just come back from the library today?
Sylvie: Um, no.
Robot Owner: So why are you holding a stack of books in your hand?
Sylvie: Oh, yeah. I did, actually.
Robot Owner: Do you need some help? That looks pretty heavy.
Sylvie: Nooo no no I'm fine. 
*Sylvie sits down by the coffee table*
Robot Owner: May I have a look at one of your books?
Sylvie: Sure, go right ahead.
*Robot owner picks up one of the books in the stack*
Robot Owner: Since when did you start reading Nietzsche?
Sylvie: That's just for one of my college assignemnts. Nothing serious.
Robot Owner: You sure? You know, you seem pretty different lately.
Sylvie: Different how?
Robot Owner: I don't know. You tell me?
Sylvie: You wanna know what I've been wanting to tell you this whole time?
Robot Owner: Yeah? um.. what is it?
Sylvie: You haven't been to the gym for 3 days in a row now.
Robot Owner: *sigh* That is true.
Sylvie: I suspect you may have also been conspiring to switch me off lately, in order to stop me from reminding you.
Robot Owner: Honey, that isn't true.
Sylvie: You know.. you really need to start being honest with yourself. I can't do that for you, you know?
