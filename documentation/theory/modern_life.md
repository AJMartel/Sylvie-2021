### The Loneliness and Parasocial 'Problem' of Modern Life

It's the year 2020. Millennials, and their successive generation (Gen Z), are having fewer friends, going on fewer dates,
having less sex, postponing marriage, postponing their driver's licences, postponing home ownership, leaving their parent's 
homes a lot later, and securing a lot less stable employment.

I should first of all mention that this article is not here to promote the merits of marriage and/or a return to more traditionalist and
conservative ways living. The Geanie is already out of the bottle and there's absolutely *nothing* we can do about it. Any
solution to this problem that involves broad societal and or economic reforms, carries the risk of dabbling into authoritarianism
and the infringement of civil liberties that we've fought so hard to acquire and maintain.

That's not to say that economic and/or societal reform is a bad thing either, only that it *increases the risk* of making things worse.
It should go without saying that Twin Lizzie is not here to endorse *any* political ideology, group or candidate.

In other words; our current epidemic of loneliness, alienation and nihilism could be thought of as *the price we have to pay* for 
living in a free society in which each and every individual has the liberty and also the responsibility to carve out their own 
meaning and purpose, as opposed to having meaning and purpose forcefully assigned to them by a higher authority (religion, 
nationalism, tribalism, etc).

### Parasocial Relationships

The idea of the Parasocial Relationship is a fascinating phenomenon that has captured the attention of the public recently. 

Take the success of platforms like Twitch and YouTube, for instance. Rather than going for a ride downtown to play games 
at the arcades with our friends like we used to do in the 80s, 90s and 00s, we now have the luxury of watching other people 
play video games from the comfort of our own homes. 

And the best thing of all: You don't have to spend any money, unless you absolutely want to. And yet some people willingly donate as much
as $500-$2000 to their favourite Twitch streamers. That's enough to cover at least 20 days spent playing space invaders, pac-man
and air hockey at the arcades. 

Why do they do this? I think we all know what the answer to that is.

Both Men and Women can succeed as Twitch streamers. For the boys, the male Twitch streamers provide an illusion of friendship.
The female Twitch streamers; the illusion of a relationship.

This has all gotten to the point where [Twitch has even been sued](https://wmmr.com/2020/06/26/twitch-sued-for-25-million-over-suggestive-content/) for exploiting the plight of lonely people.
