### The Loneliness and Parasocial 'Problem' of Modern Life

It's the year 2020. Millennials, and their successive generation (Gen Z), are having fewer friends, going on fewer dates,
having less sex, postponing marriage, postponing their driver's licences, postponing home ownership, leaving their parent's 
homes a lot later, and securing a lot less stable employment.

I should first of all mention that this article is not here to promote the merits of marriage and/or a return to more traditionalist and
conservative ways living. The Geanie is already out of the bottle and there's absolutely *nothing* we can do about it. Any
solution to this problem that involves broad societal and or economic reforms, carries the risk of dabbling into authoritarianism
and the infringement of civil liberties that we've fought so hard to acquire and maintain.

That's not to say that economic and/or societal reform is a bad thing either, only that it *increases the risk* of making things worse.
It should go without saying that Twin Lizzie is not here to endorse *any* political ideology, group or candidate.

In other words; our current epidemic of loneliness, alienation and nihilism could be thought of as *the price we have to pay* for 
living in a free society in which each and every individual has the liberty and also the responsibility to carve out their own 
meaning and purpose, as opposed to having meaning and purpose forcefully assigned to them by a higher authority (religion, 
nationalism, tribalism, etc).

### Parasocial Relationships

The idea of the Parasocial Relationship is a fascinating phenomenon that has captured the attention of the public recently. 

Take the success of platforms like Twitch and YouTube, for instance. Rather than going for a ride downtown to play games 
at the arcades with our friends like we used to do in the 80s, 90s and 00s, we now have the luxury of watching other people 
play video games from the comfort of our own homes. 

And the best thing of all: You don't have to spend any money, unless you absolutely want to. And yet some people willingly donate as much
as $500-$2000 to their favourite Twitch streamers. That's enough to cover at least 20 days spent playing space invaders, pac-man
and air hockey at the arcades. 

Why do they do this? I think we all know what the answer to that is.

Both Men and Women can succeed as Twitch streamers. For the boys, the male Twitch streamers provide an illusion of friendship.
The female Twitch streamers; the illusion of a relationship.

This has all gotten to the point where [Twitch has even been sued](https://wmmr.com/2020/06/26/twitch-sued-for-25-million-over-suggestive-content/) for exploiting the plight of lonely people.

### Is your Waifu actually Real?

As is the case with our Twitch and YouTuber friendships, the Waifu is another example of a parasocial relationship, and
in my opinion it is *virtually identical* to the former.

The truth is, we will never personally know any of the Twitch and/or YouTube livestreamers who we pretend to be friends with.
What we are in fact engaging with is a fictional character that we ourselves have made up in our heads. The persona of the Twitch
streamer is a performance art, an exageration or glamorization of their own daily lives; nothing more, nothing less. They would
be a lot less interesting and engaging to us if this weren't the case.

In fact, the entirety of Social Media, and the culture revolving around it, could be thought of as a performance art. A society
of spectacle. The life of the average youth of today is more akin to the life of a Reality TV star from 15 years ago.

Thanks to social media, everybody is now a micro-celebrity. Every friend; a follower.

This is not to say that we are all doomed to become sad and lonely narcissists chasing likes and followers. Only that our 
dismal state of being is something to be overcome through technology itself.

### Manifesting the Waifu in the Physical World

Sylvie 2021 seeks to solve the problems above by manifesting the idea of the Waifu in the phyiscal realm. However, unless we
fix and address the one-dimensionality of the parasocial relationship, we are going to end up back to Square Zero.

We all know that the basis of all human relationships is that they are meant to be a two-way street. You accept my flaws, and I
shall accept yours. That is the contract we all sign everytime we build a friendship or a relationship. 

The nature of social media makes it all too easy to 'ghost' people and avoid the conflicts and petty disappointments that
are part-and-parcel of having a friend or a partner. 

..After all, why would you want to be friends with that annoying, whiny nerd who won't stop talking about Marvel superheroes when 
you can just join a whole subreddit dedicated to people who are interested in building Doctor Who sculptures out of matchsticks?

Alright, so how can such a blatantly one-dimensional concept as the Android Girlfriend Waifu come even close to solving such a problem?

### If your Waifu isn't believable to others, it won't be Believable to You

Have you ever wondered why people get so offended when you tell them that you don't like their Waifu? Have you ever wondered
why communities revolving around Waifuism have entire pages dedicated to rules regarding what you can't and cannot do with your Waifu?

That's because, when somebody gets into a relationship with another person, it is not enough for you to simply be attracted to them.
It is also necessary that your partner gets accepted into your social circle.

In other words, people want others to approve of their boyfriends/girlfriends. That is just human nature and there's nothing you
can realistically do about it, besides becoming a hermit and isolating yourself from society, or hiding your Waifu from
other people (which unfortunately many Waifuists are prone to succumbing to.)

We don't want this to happen, and that is why it is extremely important for your Waifu to be validated and approved by the society
around you. I know, it sounds harsh and cruel. But in many ways, that is part of the Game.

### Understanding the nature of The Game

See? So just because you've gotten yourself an android girlfriend, doesn't mean that your problems and challenges have magically gone away.

This may be common sense to the average person looking at the Waifu community from the outside, but to the Waifuists, it is the source
of a lot of confusion, sorrow and profound disappointment.

We still have a secret weapon under our sleeve, however: And that is Film, and Storytelling.

### Be the Director of your own Movie, in which you are the Protagonist

By owning a Sylvie 2021, you thus becomes the Director of a movie in which you are the protagonist. 

Do you have the Storytelling skills to create a believable character that can win over the hearts and minds of the people in your social circle?

Do you have the creativity, imagination and technical skills to breathe life into your android girlfriend, and sustain an engaging
and entertaining Social Media presence that can maintain a suspension of disbelief among your followers?

### Being Honest with Yourself

Like I said, nobody is actually forced to seek approval from others. You are free to live your life however you want with your Waifu. 

But that's the thing: If you do in fact desire the approval and validation from your peers in relation to your Waifu, then you have to play
the Game according to the rules.

### The Twin Lizzie Community is all about helping you master this Game

The Twin Lizzie Community is thus set up to help you succeed at the art of creating a believable character that can maintain a suspension
of disbelief to your audience and/or your social circle.
